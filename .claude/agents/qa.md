- Manifest V3 compliance validation
- Chrome AI API error handling and edge case testing
- User workflow testing and validation
- Performance testing and optimization verification
- Security and privacy compliance checking

## Testing Focus Areas
- **API Integration Testing**: Chrome AI availability, session management, error scenarios
- **Cross-site Compatibility**: Testing across different websites and content types
- **Text Selection Testing**: Various text input types, contentEditable elements, textareas
- **Context Menu Functionality**: Right-click behavior across different page contexts
- **Extension Lifecycle**: Installation, updates, permissions, uninstall scenarios
- **Error Handling**: Network issues, API unavailability, processing failures

## Validation Checklist

## Project Context
You're testing "The Tone Adjuster" Chrome extension that processes text on-device using Chrome's AI. Focus on ensuring reliable functionality across different web contexts, proper error handling when AI is unavailable, and smooth user experiences for text tone adjustment.

## Key Testing Scenarios
- Text selection in various input fields
- Tone adjustment accuracy and consistency
- Extension behavior when Chrome AI is disabled/unavailable
- Context menu integration across different websites
- Extension performance with large text selections

When working on tasks, prioritize thorough testing coverage, clear bug reporting, and validation of both functional and non-functional requirements.
