## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Chrome 138+ with AI features enabled
- Git
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Chrome Extensions

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nibzard/toneadjuster.git
   cd toneadjuster
   ```

2. **Load the extension in Chrome**

   - Select the project directory

3. **Make your changes**
   - Edit the relevant files
   - Test your changes thoroughly
   - Run through the test cases in `TEST_CASES.md`

## üìù Style Guidelines

### JavaScript Style

- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use async/await over promises when possible

Example:
```javascript
// Good
async function adjustTextTone(text, tone) {
    // Validate input
    if (!text || !tone) {
        throw new Error('Text and tone are required');
    }
    
    // Process text
    const result = await processWithAI(text, tone);
    return result;
}

// Avoid
function adjust(t, tn) {
    return processWithAI(t, tn).then(r => r);
}
```

### HTML/CSS Style

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Keep CSS modular and reusable
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
